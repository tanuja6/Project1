# Password Generator in Python
It’s important to protect your personal information online, and in this project you’ll create a program to generate passwords for you.
The best data security practice is not to let anyone but yourself generate your most important passwords. So, to use these passwords for your wi-fi encryption or for that extra Gmail account, but you shouldn't use any online service to generate passwords for highly sensitive things, such as your online bank account.
The passwords will be random, so no one will be able to guess them!
